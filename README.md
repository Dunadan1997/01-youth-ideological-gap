# Are young men and women more and more ideologically divided?

## As recent article by the Financil Times (FT) suggests an ideology gap is growing between young men and women in countries across the world - does this apply to Switzerland?

Switzerland is a diverse country. Home to three of the main western european languages (German, French, and Italian), an economic and cultural hub at the center of the continent, Switzerland is in many ways a reflection of the rest of Europe (and it's own unique place too!). What better place, then, then to look at Switizerland for burguoning european trends. 

In this analysis, I replicated one of the FT's analysis to examine if, indeed, a new gender divide is emerging between men and women aged 18 to 29. The data suggests a nuanced picture. 

* In Switzerland as a whole, young men and women don't appear to be diverging ideologically. The trend lines seem to correlate quite well, and both sexes appear to be growing more left-wing, at least since 2015.
* The landscape changes slightly when we break down Switzerland by linguistic region. I see at least three possible trends:
  * In Swiss-Germany, there is no clear the ideological gap emerging. In fact, swiss-german men seemed to be catching up to their 
  * In the french speaking and bilingual cantons,
  * In Swiss-Italy, the trend is a bit fuzzy. It would seem that young women are growing more right-wing, while young men appear to fluctuate between both sides of the ideological spectrum. Honestly, I wouldn't bet my life against these trends being significant, statistically speaking. It appears like a quirk in the sample data. 

I was driven to follow up on the FT's article because I find these trends alarming. We'll be better off fighting human suffering the more common ground we share. Of course, this is just my personal opinion! Nothing more, nothing less.

Thank you to the FT and to its data journalist, John Burn-Murdoch, for inspiring this analysis.
