# Are young men and women becoming more ideologically divided?

## A recent Financial Times (FT) article suggests a growing ideology gap between young men and women worldwide. Does this hold true for Switzerland, a blueprint of Western Europe?

Switzerland, a diverse country with three major Western European languages (German, French, and Italian), serves as an economic and cultural hub at the center of the continent. With a history echoing the development of the European Union, Switzerland reflects both the broader European landscape and its own unique identity. What better place to examine burgeoning European trends?

In this analysis, I replicated one of the FT's studies to explore whether a new gender divide is emerging among men and women aged 18 to 29 in Switzerland. The data paints a nuanced picture. 

* In Switzerland overall, young men and women don't seem to be diverging ideologically. The trend lines show a mild positive correlation, and both sexes appear to be leaning more left-wing, especially since 2015.
* The landscape shifts slightly when we break down Switzerland by linguistic region. I see at least three potential trends:
  * In Swiss-Germany, no clear ideological gap seems to be emerging. In fact, young Swiss-German men appear to be catching up with their French-speaking counterparts and are growing more left-wing. This seems to apply to young swiss-german women too.
  * In the French-speaking and bilingual cantons, an ideological gap could be emerging. Historically, young Swiss-French men have been more left-wing than their German-speaking counterparts, yet this might be changing. While young women have shifted further left since 2015, this movement appears to have stalled among Swiss-French young men in recent years. The emerging gender gap is most visible in bilingual cantons, where both sexes seem to be moving in opposite directions.
  * It seems that young women are becoming more right-wing, while young men appear to fluctuate between both sides of the ideological spectrum. Honestly, I wouldn't bet my life against these trends being statistically significant. It looks more like a quirk specific to the sample data.

I am relieved not to find a clear trend indicating an emerging ideology gap between young men and women in Switzerland. I find this possibility alarming, as we'll be better off fighting human suffering with more common ground. Of course, this is just my personal opinion! Nothing more, nothing less.

Thank you to the FT and its data journalist, John Burn-Murdoch, for inspiring this analysis.
