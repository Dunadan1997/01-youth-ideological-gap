# Are young men and women becoming more ideologically divided?

## A recent _Financial Times_ (FT) article suggests a growing ideology gap between young men and women worldwide. Does this hold true for Switzerland, a blueprint of Western Europe?

Switzerland, a diverse country with three major Western European languages (German, French, and Italian), serves as an economic and cultural hub at the center of the continent. With a history closely connected with its neighbouring countries, Switzerland reflects both the broader European landscape and its own unique identity. What better place to examine burgeoning European trends?

In this analysis, I replicated one of the FT's studies to explore whether a new gender divide is emerging among men and women aged 18 to 29 in Switzerland. The data paints a nuanced picture. 

* In Switzerland overall, young men and women don't seem to be diverging ideologically. The trend lines show a mild positive correlation, and both sexes appear to be leaning more left-wing, especially since 2015.
* The landscape shifts slightly when we break down Switzerland by linguistic region. I see at least three potential trends:
  * In Swiss-Germany, no clear ideological gap seems to be emerging. In fact, young Swiss-German men appear to be catching up with their French-speaking counterparts and are growing more left-wing. This seems to apply to young Swiss-German women too.
  * In the French-speaking and bilingual cantons, an ideological gap could be emerging. While young Swiss-French women have shifted further left since 2015, this movement appears to have stalled among Swiss-French young men in recent years. The emerging gender gap is most visible in bilingual cantons, where both sexes seem to be moving in opposite directions.
  * It seems that young women are becoming more right-wing, while young men appear to fluctuate between both sides of the ideological spectrum. Honestly, I wouldn't bet my life against these trends being statistically significant. It looks more like a quirk specific to the sample data.

I am relieved not to find a clear trend indicating an emerging ideology gap between young men and women in Switzerland. I find this possibility alarming, as we'll be better off fighting human suffering with more common ground. Of course, this is just my personal opinion! Nothing more, nothing less.
