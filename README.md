# Are young men and women more and more ideologically divided?

## A recent article by the Financil Times (FT) suggests an ideology gap is growing between young men and women in countries across the world - is this true for Switzerland, a blueprint of Western Europe?

Switzerland is a diverse country. Home to three of the main western european languages (German, French, and Italian), an economic and cultural hub at the center of the continent, with an history eachoed in the development of the Europen Union, Switzerland is in many ways a reflection of the rest of Europe (as well as it's own unique place too!). What better place, then, then to look at Switizerland for burguoning european trends. 

In this analysis, I replicated one of the FT's analysis to examine if, indeed, a new gender divide is emerging between men and women aged 18 to 29. The data suggests a nuanced picture. 

* In Switzerland as a whole, young men and women don't appear to be diverging ideologically. The trend lines seem to correlate quite well, and, in general, both sexes appear to be growing more left-wing, at least since 2015.
* The landscape changes slightly when we break down Switzerland by linguistic region. I see at least three possible trends:
  * In Swiss-Germany, no clear ideological gap seems to be emerging. In fact, young Swiss-German men appear to be catching up with their French-speaking counterparts and are growing more left-wing. This seems to apply to young swiss-german women too.
  * In the French-speaking and bilingual cantons, an ideological gap could be emerging. Historically, young men have been more left-wing than their German-speaking counterparts, though this might be changing. While young women have shifted further left since 2015, this movement appears to have stalled among young men in recent years. The emerging gender gap is most visible in bilingual cantons, where both sexes seem to be moving in opposite directions.
  * In Swiss-Italy, the trends are a bit fuzzy. It would seem that young women are growing more right-wing, while young men appear to fluctuate between both sides of the ideological spectrum. Honestly, I wouldn't bet my life against these trends being significant, statistically speaking. It appears like a quirk specific to the sample data. 

I am relieved not to find a clear trend showing an emerging ideology gap between young men and women. I find this possibility alarming. We'll be better off fighting human suffering the more common ground we share. Of course, this is just my personal opinion! Nothing more, nothing less.

Thank you to the FT and to its data journalist, John Burn-Murdoch, for inspiring this analysis.
